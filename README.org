Jinx is a just-in-time spell-checker for Emacs. Jinx highlights misspelled words in the text of the visible portion of the buffer. Each misspelling can then be corrected from a list of dictionary words presented as the usual completion candidates in a list.

Installing Jinx is straight-forward and configuring takes not much intervention. Jinx can safely co-exist with Emacs's built-in spell-checker.

Jinx's high performance and low resource usage comes from directly calling the widely-used API of the Enchant library (see [[https://abiword.github.io/enchant/][libenchant]]).  Jinx package automatically compiles =jinx-mod.c= and loads the dynamic module at startup. 

Jinx highlights misspellings lazily, recognizes window boundaries and text folding, if any. By binding directly to the native libenchant API, Jinx avoids the slower backend process communication with Aspell. Thanks to libenchant API, this method is widely used by text editors and supports [[https://nuspell.github.io/][Nuspell]], [[http://hunspell.github.io/][Hunspell]], [[http://aspell.net/][Aspell]] and a few lesser known
backends.  

Jinx supports spell-checking multiple languages in the same buffer. See the =jinx-languages= variable to customize. 

Jinx can flexibly ignore misspellings via faces (=jinx-exclude-faces= and =jinx-include-faces=), regular
expressions (=jinx-exclude-regexps=), and programmable predicates. Jinx comes preconfigured for the most important Emacs major modes.

* Installing Jinx

Jinx can be installed from GNU ELPA and MELPA directly or with =package-install=. 

Jinx requires =libenchant=. Enchant library is a required dependency for Jinx to compile its module at install time. If =pkg-config= is available, Jinx will use that to locate =libenchant=. 

On Debian or Ubuntu, install packages =libenchant-2-2=, =libenchant-2-dev= and =pkg-config=.

On Fedora or RHEL, install the package =enchant2-devel=.

On Mac or Darwin systems, install =enchant2= and =pkgconfig=.

* Using Jinx

Jinx has two modes: the command, =global-jinx-mode= activates globally; and the command, =jinx-mode=, for activiating for specific modes.  

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'global-jinx-mode)

  (dolist (hook '(text-mode-hook prog-mode-hook conf-mode-hook))
    (add-hook hook #'jinx-mode))
#+end_src

A sample configuration with the popular =use-package= macro is shown here:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package jinx
  :commands (jinx-correct jinx-languages)
  :hook (emacs-startup . global-jinx-mode)
  :bind ([remap ispell-word] . jinx-correct))
#+end_src

Jinx autoloads the commands =jinx-correct= and =jinx-languages=. Invoking =jinx-correct= corrects the misspellings. Binding =jinx-correct= to =M-$= chord takes over that chord from Emacs's default assignment to =ispell word=. Since Jinx is independent of the Emacs's Ispell package, =M-$= can be re-used. The =use-package= definition above shows that. The same reassignment using regular keymap is shown below:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (keymap-global-set "<remap> <ispell-word>" #'jinx-correct)
#+end_src

=M-$= triggers correction for the misspelled word next to point. 

=C-u M-$= triggers correction for the entire buffer. 

* Enchant backends and personal dictionaries

Enchant uses different backends for different languages (to be spell-checked). The backends are ordered as specified in the configuration file =~/.config/enchant/enchant.ordering=. For most languages, Enchant uses Hunspell by default. 

Depending on the backend the personal dictionary will be taken from different locations, e.g., =~/.aspell.LANG.pws= or =~/.config/enchant/=. It is possible to symlink different personal dictionaries
such that they are shared by different spell checkers. See the [[https://abiword.github.io/enchant/src/enchant.html][Enchant manual]] for details.

* Alternate spell check programs

- [[https://github.com/astoff/jit-spell][jit-spell]]: Jinx UI borrows ideas from Augusto Stoffel's jit-spell even if one is Jit-spell uses Ispell process communication instead Jinx's native API approach. Jit-spell does not highlight just the visible text, which has load and latency consequences especially in combination with stealth locking and eager fontification. This overhead is similar to to =consult-line= from my [[https://github.com/minad/consult][Consult]] package.

- [[https://codeberg.org/ideasman42/emacs-spell-fu][spell-fu]]: The idea to highlight misspellings just in the visible text portion of the buffer came from  Campbell Barton's spell-fu package. Spell-fu however incurrs high memory on account of its dictionary in a hash table. For languages with compound words and inflected word forms, this memory overhead tends to be significant. Jinx avoid this overhead in two ways. First by directly accessing the enchant API. Second by using enchant's advanced spell-checker algorithms (affixation, compound words, etc.).

- flyspell: Flyspell is Emacs's built-in package. Flyspelll highlights misspellings while typing. Each word under the cursor is spell-checked and underlined if mistyped. Jinx, on the other hand, checks not just each word, but the entire visible text of the buffer at once.

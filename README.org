Jinx is a fast just-in-time spell-checker for Emacs. Jinx highlights misspelled
words in the text of the visible portion of the buffer. For efficiency, Jinx
highlights misspellings lazily, recognizes window boundaries and text folding,
if any. Each misspelling can then be corrected from a list of dictionary words
presented as completion candidates in a list.

Installing Jinx is straight-forward and configuring takes not much intervention.
Jinx can safely co-exist with Emacs's built-in spell-checker.

Jinx's high performance and low resource usage comes from directly calling the
widely-used API of the Enchant library (see [[https://abiword.github.io/enchant/][libenchant]]). Jinx automatically
compiles =jinx-mod.c= and loads the dynamic module at startup. By binding directly
to the native Enchant API, Jinx avoids the slower backend process communication
with Aspell. Thanks to the Enchant API, this method is widely used by other text
editors and supports [[https://nuspell.github.io/][Nuspell]], [[http://hunspell.github.io/][Hunspell]], [[http://aspell.net/][Aspell]] and a few lesser known backends.

Jinx supports spell-checking multiple languages in the same buffer. See the
=jinx-languages= variable to customize for multiple languages. Jinx can flexibly
ignore misspellings via faces (=jinx-exclude-faces= and =jinx-include-faces=),
regular expressions (=jinx-exclude-regexps=), and programmable predicates. Jinx
comes preconfigured for the most important Emacs major modes.

* Installing Jinx

Jinx can be installed from GNU ELPA and MELPA directly or with =package-install=.

Jinx requires =libenchant=. Enchant library is a required dependency for Jinx to
compile its module at install time. If =pkg-config= is available when installing
Jinx, Jinx will use =pkg-config= to locate =libenchant=.

On Debian or Ubuntu, install packages =libenchant-2-2=, =libenchant-2-dev= and
=pkg-config=. On Fedora or RHEL, install the package =enchant2-devel=. On Mac,
install =enchant2= and =pkgconfig=.

* Using Jinx

Jinx has two modes: the command, =global-jinx-mode= activates globally; and the
command, =jinx-mode=, for activating for specific modes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'global-jinx-mode)

  (dolist (hook '(text-mode-hook prog-mode-hook conf-mode-hook))
    (add-hook hook #'jinx-mode))
#+end_src

Jinx autoloads the commands =jinx-correct= and =jinx-languages=. Invoking
=jinx-correct= corrects the misspellings. Binding =jinx-correct= to =M-$= chord takes
over that chord from Emacs's default assignment to =ispell word=. Since Jinx is
independent of the Emacs's Ispell package, =M-$= can be re-used. The =use-package=
definition above shows that. The same reassignment using regular keymap is shown
below:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (keymap-global-set "<remap> <ispell-word>" #'jinx-correct)
#+end_src

- =M-$= triggers correction for the misspelled word next to point.
- =C-u M-$= triggers correction for the entire buffer.

A sample configuration with the popular =use-package= macro is shown here:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package jinx
    :hook (emacs-startup . global-jinx-mode)
    :bind ([remap ispell-word] . jinx-correct))
#+end_src

* Enchant backends and personal dictionaries

Enchant uses different backends for different languages (to be spell-checked).
The backends are ordered as specified in the configuration file
=~/.config/enchant/enchant.ordering=. For most languages, Enchant uses Hunspell by
default.

Depending on the backend the personal dictionary will be taken from different
locations, e.g., =~/.aspell.LANG.pws= or =~/.config/enchant/=. It is possible to
symlink different personal dictionaries such that they are shared by different
spell checkers. See the [[https://abiword.github.io/enchant/src/enchant.html][Enchant manual]] for details.

* Alternative spell-checking packages

- [[https://github.com/astoff/jit-spell][jit-spell]]: Jinx UI borrows ideas from Augusto Stoffel's Jit-spell. Jit-spell
  uses the less efficient Ispell process communication instead Jinx's calling
  native API. Since Jit-spell highlights misspellings in the entire buffer and
  does not confine to just the visible text, Jit-spell has load and latency
  consequences especially in stealth locking and eager fontification.

- [[https://codeberg.org/ideasman42/emacs-spell-fu][spell-fu]]: The idea to highlight misspellings just in the visible text portion
  of the buffer came from Campbell Barton's spell-fu package. Spell-fu however
  incurs high memory overhead on account of its dictionary in a hash table. For
  languages with compound words and inflected word forms, this memory overhead
  magnifies. By accessing the Enchant API directly, Jinx avoids this overhead.
  Jinx also benefits from Enchant's advanced spell-checker algorithms
  (affixation, compound words, etc.).

- flyspell: Flyspell is Emacs's built-in package. Flyspell highlights
  misspellings in realtime, while typing. Each word under the cursor is
  spell-checked and underlined if mistyped. Jinx, on the other hand, is more
  effective because it checks for misspellings in the entire visible text of the
  buffer at once.
